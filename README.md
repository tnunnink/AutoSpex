### Usage

### Motivation
My motivation for this project was primarily driven out of a desire to automate repetitive, trival, yet tedious
quality assuance checks for our PLC projects to ensure they met required client specifications. This included
validation of module/task/program configurations, tag data, code structures, and some basic PLC best practices.
